==================

> Lab 2 of ECSE 211 at McGill, by AJ Ostrow and Vitaliy Kuzmin, Fall 2013. 

The NXT robot slips when it turns, so keep track of the start location (the origin) and
account for the slip with the final reading. The odometer seems to be making excellent
readings when accounting for the slip.
